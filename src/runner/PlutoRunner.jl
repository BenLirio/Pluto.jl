# Will be evaluated _inside_ the workspace process.

# Pluto does most things on process 1 (the server), and it uses little workspace processes to evaluate notebook code in.
# These baby processes don't import Pluto, they only import this module. Functions from this module are called by WorkspaceManager.jl, using Distributed

# So when reading this file, pretend that you are living in process 2, and you are communicating with Pluto's server, who lives in process 1.

"""
Move some of the globals over from one workspace to another. This is how Pluto "deletes" globals - it doesn't, it just executes your new code in a new module where those globals are not defined. 

Notebook code does run in `Main` - it runs in workspace modules. Every time that you run cells, a new module is created, called `Main.workspace123` with `123` an increasing number.

The trick boils down to two things:
1. When we create a new workspace module, we move over some of the global from the old workspace. (But not the ones that we want to 'delete'!)
2. If a function used to be defined, but now we want to delete it, then we go through the method table of that function and snoop out all methods that we defined by us, and not by another package. This is how we reverse extending external functions. For example, if you run a cell with `Base.sqrt(s::String) = "the square root of" * s`, and then delete that cell, then you can still call `sqrt(1)` but `sqrt("one")` will err. Cool right!
